Use H1, H2, H3 hierarchy with keywords.

Optimize images with alt tags (e.g., “Nairobi concert crowd 2025”).

Add internal linking (e.g., event page links to hotel booking).

🔗 5. Off-Page SEO (Backlinks)

Partner with Kenyan bloggers, media houses (Nation, Standard, Pulse Live) for backlinks.

Collaborate with event organizers → their official sites link to ShikaTicket.
