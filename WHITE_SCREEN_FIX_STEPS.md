# White Screen After OTP Entry - Fix Steps

## Problem
White screen appears after entering OTP at: `https://shikaticket.com/public/travel/verify-otp`

## Possible Causes
1. Verification succeeded but redirect failed (base_url issue)
2. Error in verification process
3. Missing files not uploaded
4. Session issue

## 🔍 Step 1: Check if Verification Actually Worked

Upload and run: **`check_verification_status.php`**

Visit: `https://shikaticket.com/check_verification_status.php`

**This will show:**
- ✅ If your phone was actually verified (even if redirect failed)
- ✅ Recent error logs showing what went wrong
- ✅ All agencies and their verification status

**If phone shows "✅ Verified":**
- Verification worked! Just a redirect issue.
- You can now login directly at `/travel/login`

**If phone shows "❌ Not Verified":**
- Verification failed. Check error logs in the output.

## ✅ Step 2: Upload Missing Files

Make sure ALL these files are uploaded:

1. **`config/config.php`** (with timezone fix)
2. **`app/Controllers/TravelAuthController.php`** (with error handling)
3. **`app/Views/travel/auth/verify-otp.php`**
4. **`public/index.php`** (with routes)

---

## ⚡ Step 3: Quick Test

After uploading files:

1. Go to: `https://shikaticket.com/public/travel/login`
2. Try logging in with your agency credentials
3. If already verified → should login successfully ✅
4. If not verified → will send new OTP → verify again

## 🛠️ Step 4: If Still White Screen

**Manual Fix via SQL:**
```sql
-- Verify the agency manually
UPDATE travel_agencies 
SET phone_verified = 1 
WHERE phone = '+254 792758752';

-- Also approve if needed
UPDATE travel_agencies 
SET is_approved = 1 
WHERE phone = '+254 792758752';
```

Then try logging in at: `/travel/login`
