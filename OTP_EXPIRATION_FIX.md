# OTP Expiration & Resend Button Fix

## Problems Fixed

1. ✅ **OTP expires too quickly** - Increased from 10 to 30 minutes
2. ✅ **Resend OTP button not working** - Fixed nested form issue

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Extended OTP Expiration Time

**Before:** 10 minutes (600 seconds)  
**After:** 30 minutes (1800 seconds)

**Changed in 3 places:**
- Registration OTP (line 179)
- Login OTP (line 55)
- Resend OTP (line 332)

**SMS message updated:**
```
Your ShikaTicket verification code is: 123456. Valid for 30 minutes.
```

### 2. Fixed Resend OTP Button

**Problem:** Form was nested inside another form  
**Solution:** Moved resend form outside main verification form

**Before (Broken):**
```html
<form method="POST" action="/travel/verify-otp">
    <!-- OTP input -->
    <button>Verify</button>
    
    <!-- Nested form - doesn't work! -->
    <form method="POST" action="/travel/resend-otp">
        <button>Resend OTP</button>
    </form>
</form>
```

**After (Fixed):**
```html
<form method="POST" action="/travel/verify-otp">
    <!-- OTP input -->
    <button>Verify</button>
</form>

<!-- Separate form - works! -->
<form method="POST" action="/travel/resend-otp">
    <button>Resend OTP</button>
</form>
```

## Testing

### Test 1: OTP Expiration
1. Register new agency or try login
2. Receive OTP SMS
3. Wait 5-10 minutes
4. Enter OTP
5. Should still work (not expired) ✅

### Test 2: Resend Button
1. On verification page
2. Click "Resend OTP" button
3. Should see: "A new OTP has been sent to your phone"
4. Check phone for new SMS ✅
5. Enter new OTP
6. Should verify successfully ✅

---

## Expected Behavior

### New OTP Timeline:
- **Generated:** When user registers or logs in
- **Expires:** After 30 minutes
- **Can resend:** Anytime before expiration
- **Old OTP deleted:** When new one is generated

### Resend OTP Flow:
1. Click "Resend OTP"
2. Old OTP deleted
3. New OTP generated (valid 30 minutes)
4. SMS sent to phone
5. Success message shown
6. User enters new code
7. Verification successful ✅

---

## Why 30 Minutes?

**Reasons for extending to 30 minutes:**
- SMS delivery can be delayed (network issues)
- Users may be busy when they receive SMS
- Entering wrong code a few times needs buffer
- Industry standard is 15-30 minutes
- Better user experience

---

## Security Considerations

✅ **Still Secure:**
- OTP is 6 digits (1 million combinations)
- One-time use (deleted after verification)
- Deleted when new OTP requested
- Session-based (can't be used by others)
- CSRF protected

---

## Troubleshooting

### If OTP still expires immediately:

**Check server time:**
```sql
SELECT NOW() as server_time;
```

**Check OTP in database:**
```sql
SELECT agency_id, token, expires_at, created_at 
FROM travel_agency_tokens 
ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1;
```

**Compare:**
- If `expires_at` is less than `NOW()` → OTP expired
- If `expires_at` > `NOW()` by 30 minutes → Working correctly ✅

### If Resend button still not working:

1. Check browser console for errors (F12)
2. Verify file was uploaded correctly
3. Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check that both forms are separate (not nested)

---

## Summary

**Problem 1:** OTP expired in 10 minutes (too fast)  
**Solution 1:** Extended to 30 minutes  

**Problem 2:** Resend button not working (nested forms)  
**Solution 2:** Separated forms  

**Files:** 2 files changed  
**Risk:** NONE (improves user experience)  
**Priority:** HIGH (improves success rate)
