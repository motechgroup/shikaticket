## 1.0.1 ‚Äî Admin destination editing + HTML changelog

> Minor feature release enabling destination management from the Admin and improving changelog visibility.

### Added
- Admin can edit Travel Destinations: new routes, controller actions, and form at `/admin/travel/destinations` (Edit, Publish/Unpublish, Feature/Unfeature).
- Admin can edit Travel Agencies: new routes, controller actions, and form at `/admin/travel/agencies` (edit profile, status flags, logo upload, commission).
- Styled HTML changelog page at `/changelog.html` for quick in-app viewing.

### Changed
- Admin dashboard footer link now points to the HTML changelog (`/changelog.html`).
- CSRF protection added to admin edit/update forms; update endpoints now require POST and redirect on direct GET.

### Fixed
- Broken QR image on booking/ticket pages (ngrok/HTTPS). Introduced local QR proxy at `/qr.php` and switched all QR renders/downloads to use it.
- Travel agency phone normalization at registration and profile update to prevent `+254 254...` duplicates (improves SMS delivery and OTP).

### Added
- Travel agency login allowed before phone verification/approval; posting remains gated. OTP screen includes "Skip for now" to reach dashboard.
- Universal Scanner quick links added to Admin Scans, Organizer Dashboard, and Travel Dashboard.
