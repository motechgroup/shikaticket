# Marketing & Communications Guidelines

## Brand Voice
- Friendly, concise, and trustworthy.
- Focus on value: convenience, security, unforgettable experiences.

## Channels
- Email: confirmations, receipts, reminders, newsletters (with opt-in).
- SMS: critical, time-sensitive alerts (see below). Keep under 160 chars when possible.
- Social: share events using the built-in share buttons.

## SMS Usage
- Transactional: OTPs, payment confirmations, ticket delivery, withdrawal updates.
- Reminders: day-of-event reminders with start time and venue.
- Marketing (opt-in only): featured events, early-bird announcements.
- Always include brand name; avoid spammy language and excessive frequency.

### Suggested SMS Templates
- Payment success: "ShikaTicket: Order #{{order_id}} confirmed. Tickets: {{tickets}}"
- Event reminder: "ShikaTicket: {{event_title}} today {{event_time}} at {{venue}}. See ticket: {{ticket_link}}"
- OTP: "ShikaTicket: Your OTP is {{otp}} (valid 10 min)."

## Image Guidelines (for marketing)
- Social share images (OpenGraph): 1200×630.
- Email banners: 1200×400 (optimize size < 300KB).
- Thumbnails: 600×600.

## UTM Parameters
- Append `?utm_source=...&utm_medium=...&utm_campaign=...` to links to track campaigns.

## Frequency Capping
- Respect user preferences. For marketing SMS/email: no more than 2 per week unless opted into higher frequency.
