# Travel Agency Registration Form - Readability Fix

## Problem
The travel agency registration form at `https://shikaticket.com/public/travel/register` had **unreadable labels** - dark text on dark background.

## Root Cause
Form labels had `text-gray-700` (dark gray) class, which is nearly invisible on the black background.

### Before (Broken):
```html
<label class="block text-sm font-medium text-gray-700">Company Name *</label>
<!-- Dark gray text on black background = invisible! -->
```

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Changed Label Colors
All form labels changed from `text-gray-700` to `text-gray-200` (light gray):

```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<label class="text-gray-700">Company Name *</label>

<!-- AFTER -->
<label class="text-gray-200">Company Name *</label>
```

**Changed labels:**
- Company Name
- Contact Person
- Email Address
- Phone Number
- Website
- Country
- City
- Password
- Address
- Company Description

### 2. Fixed Input Field Styling
Changed input text from `text-white` to `text-gray-900` with `bg-white` background for better readability:

```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<input class="text-white" />  <!-- White text, hard to read -->

<!-- AFTER -->
<input class="text-gray-900 bg-white" />  <!-- Dark text on white background -->
```

### 3. Fixed Select Dropdowns
Changed select fields from dark theme to light theme:

```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<select class="bg-dark-card text-white" />

<!-- AFTER -->
<select class="bg-white text-gray-900" />
```

### 4. Fixed Password Placeholder
Changed password placeholder from text to bullet points for security:

```html
<!-- BEFORE -->
<input type="password" placeholder="Minimum 6 characters" />

<!-- AFTER -->
<input type="password" placeholder="••••••" />
```
