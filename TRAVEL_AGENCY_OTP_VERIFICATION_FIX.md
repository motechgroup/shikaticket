## 📱 SMS Templates Used

The system looks for SMS template: `travel_agency_otp`

If not found, uses default message:
```
Your ShikaTicket verification code is: 123456. Valid for 10 minutes.
```

**To create custom template:**
1. Go to: Admin > SMS Templates
2. Add template key: `travel_agency_otp`
3. Add message with placeholder: `{otp}`

**Example custom message:**
```
Welcome to ShikaTicket! Your verification code is {otp}. Valid for 10 minutes. Do not share this code.
```

---

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **OTP Expiration**: 10 minutes  
✅ **One-time use**: OTP deleted after verification  
✅ **Session-based**: Temp session for verification flow  
✅ **CSRF Protection**: All POST requests protected  
✅ **Old OTP cleanup**: Previous OTPs deleted on resend  

---

## 📊 Database Changes

### `travel_agencies` table:
- Uses existing `phone_verified` column (default: 0)

### `travel_agency_tokens` table:
- **agency_id**: Agency being verified
- **token**: 6-digit OTP code
- **expires_at**: Expiration timestamp (10 minutes)
- **created_at**: When OTP was generated

**No schema changes needed** - uses existing tables ✅

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: SMS not being sent
**Check:**
1. Admin > Settings > SMS - credentials configured?
2. `public/error_log` - look for "SMS service not configured"
3. Check phone number format: `+254 792758752` ✅
4. Test SMS provider credentials
5. Check `sms_logs` table for status

**Fix:**
```sql
-- Check SMS logs
SELECT * FROM sms_logs ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check for recent OTPs
SELECT * FROM travel_agency_tokens ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 5;
```

### Issue: "Session expired. Please register again."
**Cause:** Temp session cleared or expired

**Fix:**
- User needs to register again
- Or admin can manually verify: `UPDATE travel_agencies SET phone_verified = 1 WHERE id = X;`

### Issue: OTP not expiring
**Check:**
```sql
-- View active OTPs
SELECT agency_id, token, expires_at, created_at 
FROM travel_agency_tokens 
WHERE expires_at > NOW();
```

### Issue: Can't login even after verification
**Check:**
1. Phone verified? 
   ```sql
   SELECT phone_verified FROM travel_agencies WHERE id = X;
   ```
2. Account approved?
   ```sql
   SELECT is_approved FROM travel_agencies WHERE id = X;
   ```
3. Account active?
   ```sql
   SELECT is_active FROM travel_agencies WHERE id = X;
   ```

   SELECT 
       provider,
