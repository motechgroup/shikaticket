# PDF Download Button Simplification

## Issue Resolved
The user reported that the "Download PDF" button was redirecting to the server download URL instead of generating a client-side PDF, while the "Server download" button was working correctly.

## Solution Implemented
Removed the problematic client-side PDF generation and simplified to use only the reliable server-side PDF download.

## Changes Made

### Before (Two Buttons)
```html
<div class="flex items-center space-x-2">
    <button class="btn btn-secondary text-xs" data-ticket-code="...">Download PDF</button>
    <a class="btn btn-secondary text-xs" href="/tickets/download?code=...">Server download</a>
</div>
```

### After (Single Button)
```html
<div class="flex items-center space-x-2">
    <a class="btn btn-primary text-xs" href="/tickets/download?code=...">Download PDF</a>
</div>
```
