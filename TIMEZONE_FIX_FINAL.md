# FINAL FIX: OTP Timezone Issue

## Root Cause Found! 🎯

Your debug output revealed:
- **PHP Time:** 12:26:18 (UTC timezone)
- **MySQL Time:** 15:26:18 (Africa/Nairobi = UTC+3)
- **Difference:** 3 hours!

### What Was Happening:
```
OTP created by PHP: expires at 12:56 UTC
MySQL checks with: NOW() = 15:26 Nairobi time
Comparison: 12:56 < 15:26 → EXPIRED! ❌
```

---

## ✅ The Fix

Added timezone setting to `config/config.php`:
```php
date_default_timezone_set('Africa/Nairobi');
```

Now both PHP and MySQL use the same timezone!
