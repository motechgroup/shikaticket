# Asset & Branding Guidelines

## Brand Basics
- Theme: dark (black/near-black backgrounds) with red accents (#ef4444 / #dc2626)
- Typography: Use clean sans-serif; avoid overly decorative fonts
- Tone: Modern, bold, minimal

## Logos & Iconography
- Primary logo: use provided site logo (`Admin > Settings`).
- Clear space: keep 12px minimum padding around the logo at small sizes.
- Backgrounds: prefer dark backgrounds; use white logo variant if required.

### File Formats
- SVG preferred for logos/icons. PNG fallback with transparent background.

## Favicon
- 64×64 PNG recommended (square). Upload in `Admin > Settings`.

## Event Posters
- Square 1080×1080 pixels (minimum); PNG or high-quality JPG.
- Keep essential text large and legible; avoid tiny details.
- Leave safe margins (24px) around edges for cropping/responsiveness.

## Homepage Banners
- Recommended 1600×500; minimum 1200×400.
- JPG/PNG; keep files under ~400KB where possible.
- Avoid placing critical text close to edges; include a contrasting CTA if needed.

## Partner Logos Strip
- Transparent SVG/PNG with minimal padding.
- Visual height ~40px; wide aspect ratios work well.

## QR Codes
- Generated automatically per ticket; avoid re-editing exported images.

## Social Share Previews (OpenGraph)
- Default OG image can be set in Admin > Settings > SEO (recommended 1200×630).
- Event pages automatically use event poster when available.

## Do/Don't
- Do maintain contrast (white/near-white text on dark backgrounds).
- Do keep brand red for primary actions and highlights.
- Don't stretch logos or crowd elements.
- Don't embed heavy text in images needed for accessibility.
