# ShikaTicket Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary
This security audit was conducted to assess the security posture of the ShikaTicket system before production deployment. The system demonstrates good security practices in most areas, with some areas requiring attention.

## Security Strengths ‚úÖ

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Prepared Statements**: All database queries use PDO prepared statements, preventing SQL injection
- **Input Sanitization**: User inputs are properly trimmed and validated
- **Type Casting**: Proper type casting for numeric inputs (int, float)
- **Email Validation**: Email addresses are validated using `filter_var()`

### 2. Authentication & Authorization
- **Password Hashing**: Uses `password_hash()` with `PASSWORD_DEFAULT`
- **Session Management**: Proper session handling with cleanup on logout
- **Access Control**: Role-based access with `require_admin()`, `require_organizer()`, `require_user()`
- **Phone OTP Verification**: Multi-factor authentication for organizers

### 3. CSRF Protection
- **Token Generation**: Secure CSRF tokens using `random_bytes()`
- **Token Verification**: `hash_equals()` for timing-safe comparison
- **Automatic Enforcement**: CSRF protection on all POST requests (except scanner verification)

### 4. Database Security
- **Prepared Statements**: Consistent use throughout the application
- **Error Handling**: PDO exceptions are properly caught
- **Connection Security**: Database connection with proper charset (utf8mb4)

## Security Concerns ‚ö†Ô∏è

### 1. File Upload Security (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Issues Found:**
- No file type validation beyond extension checking
- No file size limits enforced
- No malware scanning
- Potential for malicious file uploads

**Current Code:**
```php
$ext = pathinfo($_FILES['poster']['name'], PATHINFO_EXTENSION);
$filename = 'poster_' . time() . '_' . mt_rand(1000,9999) . '.' . $ext;
```

**Recommendations:**
- Implement whitelist of allowed file types
- Add file size limits
- Validate file content (MIME type verification)
- Scan uploaded files for malware

### 2. Session Security (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issues Found:**
- No session regeneration on login
- No secure session cookie settings
- Session timeout not implemented

**Recommendations:**
- Regenerate session ID on login
- Set secure session cookie flags
- Implement session timeout

### 3. Error Information Disclosure (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issues Found:**
- Database errors may expose sensitive information
- Stack traces in development mode

**Current Code:**
```php
echo 'Controller not found';
echo 'Action not found';
```

**Recommendations:**
- Implement proper error logging
- Hide sensitive error details in production
- Use generic error messages for users

### 4. Password Reset Security (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Issues Found:**
- Password reset tokens may have long expiration times
- No rate limiting on password reset requests
- No account lockout mechanism

**Recommendations:**
- Implement shorter token expiration (15-30 minutes)
- Add rate limiting for password reset requests
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts

## Security Recommendations üõ°Ô∏è

### Immediate Actions (Before Production)

1. **File Upload Security**
   - Implement strict file type validation
   - Add file size limits
   - Scan uploaded files

2. **Session Security**
   - Regenerate session ID on login
   - Set secure cookie flags
   - Implement session timeout

3. **Error Handling**
   - Disable error display in production
   - Implement proper error logging
   - Use generic error messages

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Add rate limiting to login attempts
   - Limit password reset requests
   - Implement account lockout

### Long-term Security Enhancements

1. **Security Headers**
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)
   - Add X-Frame-Options
   - Set X-Content-Type-Options

2. **Input Validation**
   - Implement server-side validation for all forms
   - Add input length limits
   - Sanitize HTML content

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - Implement security event logging
   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Track suspicious activities

## Production Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Change default admin credentials
- [ ] Set strong database passwords
- [ ] Configure HTTPS/SSL certificates
- [ ] Set proper file permissions (755 for directories, 644 for files)
- [ ] Configure secure SMTP settings
- [ ] Set up proper SMS provider credentials
- [ ] Configure M-Pesa production credentials
- [ ] Review and update all notification templates
- [ ] Test all payment integrations
- [ ] Verify scanner device security
- [ ] Implement file upload security measures
- [ ] Configure session security settings
- [ ] Set up error logging and monitoring
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Test security measures thoroughly

## Conclusion

The ShikaTicket system has a solid security foundation with proper use of prepared statements, CSRF protection, and authentication mechanisms. However, file upload security and session management require immediate attention before production deployment. Implementing the recommended security measures will significantly enhance the system's security posture.

**Overall Security Rating: 7/10**
**Production Readiness: Requires Security Enhancements**
