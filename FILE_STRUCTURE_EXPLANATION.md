# File Structure Explanation - Clean URL Setup

## 📂 **Correct File Structure:**

```
ticko/
├── .htaccess                    # ✅ NEW: Handles URL rewriting (routes to public/)
├── index.php.old               # ❌ OLD: Backup of old redirect file (not needed anymore)
├── app/                        # ✅ Application code
├── config/                     # ✅ Configuration files
├── public/                     # ✅ Web root directory
│   ├── .htaccess              # ✅ Routes requests to index.php
│   ├── index.php              # ✅ MAIN ENTRY POINT - Keep this!
│   ├── uploads/               # ✅ User uploaded files
│   └── [other assets]         # ✅ CSS, JS, images, etc.
└── [other directories]
```

## 🎯 **How It Works:**

### 1. **User visits:** `http://localhost/ticko/events`

### 2. **Root `.htaccess` intercepts:**
```apache
# Transparently redirects to public/events
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ public/$1 [L]
```

### 3. **Request becomes:** `public/events` (internally)

### 4. **Public `.htaccess` routes to front controller:**
```apache
# Routes to public/index.php
RewriteRule ^ index.php [QSA,L]
```

### 5. **`public/index.php` handles the request:**
- Loads the router
- Processes the route
- Returns the response

## ❌ **Why the Old Root `index.php` is Not Needed:**

### Old Approach (Before `.htaccess`):
```
User visits: http://localhost/ticko/
↓
Root index.php redirects to: http://localhost/ticko/public/
↓
Shows /public in URL ❌
```

### New Approach (With `.htaccess`):
```
User visits: http://localhost/ticko/
↓
Root .htaccess transparently routes to: public/ (internal)
↓
Clean URL without /public ✅
```

## ✅ **What Files to Keep:**

| File | Status | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| `/.htaccess` | ✅ **KEEP** | Routes all requests to public/ folder |
| `/public/index.php` | ✅ **KEEP** | Main application entry point |
| `/public/.htaccess` | ✅ **KEEP** | Routes requests to front controller |
| `/index.php.old` | 📦 **BACKUP** | Old redirect file (can delete later) |

---

## 🚫 **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

### ❌ **DON'T:**
- Move `public/index.php` to root
- Delete `public/index.php`
- Delete `public/.htaccess`
- Delete the `public/` folder

### ✅ **DO:**
- Keep `public/` folder intact
- Keep `public/index.php` as main entry point
- Use root `.htaccess` for URL rewriting
- Delete or backup the old root `index.php`

---

## 🔐 **Security Benefits of This Structure:**

1. **Only `public/` folder is web-accessible**
   - All application code in `app/` is protected
   - Configuration files in `config/` are protected
   - Database credentials are safe

2. **No direct access to sensitive files**
   - Users can't browse to `/app/`, `/config/`, etc.
   - `.htaccess` ensures everything goes through `public/`

3. **Standard industry practice**
   - Used by Laravel, Symfony, CodeIgniter 4
   - Recommended by PHP security guidelines

## 🧪 **Testing Your Setup:**

### Test 1: Clean URLs Work
```
Visit: http://localhost/ticko/
Should load homepage ✅
URL bar shows: http://localhost/ticko/ (no /public) ✅
```

### Test 2: Direct Public Access Still Works
```
Visit: http://localhost/ticko/public/
Should redirect or still work ✅
```

### Test 3: Assets Load Correctly
```
Check browser console for CSS/JS/image loading ✅
All assets should load from correct paths ✅
```

### Test 4: Routing Works
```
Visit: http://localhost/ticko/events
Visit: http://localhost/ticko/admin/login
Visit: http://localhost/ticko/login
All should work without /public in URL ✅
```

---

## 📝 **Summary:**

- **Root `.htaccess`** = Traffic director (routes to public/)
- **`public/index.php`** = Application entry point (the actual app)
- **Old root `index.php`** = Not needed anymore (backed up as `.old`)

**Your structure is now correct and follows best practices!** ✅

## 🆘 **If Something Goes Wrong:**

### Scenario 1: "Page Not Found" Errors
**Solution:** Restore the old `index.php.old` file
```bash
# Rename back
mv index.php.old index.php
```

### Scenario 2: Want to Revert Everything
**Solution:**
1. Delete root `.htaccess`
2. Restore root `index.php` from backup
3. Update `base_url()` in config to include `/public`
