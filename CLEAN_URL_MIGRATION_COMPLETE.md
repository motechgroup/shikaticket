# ✅ Clean URL Migration Complete

## 🎯 **Migration Summary**

Successfully moved all contents from `/public` folder to the root directory to achieve clean URLs without `/public` in the path.

## 📁 **New File Structure**

```
ticko/
├── index.php              # Main application entry point (moved from public/)
├── .htaccess              # Clean URL routing
├── uploads/               # Uploaded files (moved from public/uploads/)
├── app/                   # Application code
├── config/                # Configuration files
├── database/              # Database migrations
├── docs/                  # Documentation
├── storage/               # Storage files
└── vendor/                # Composer dependencies
```

## 🔧 **Changes Made**

### 1. **Files Moved to Root**
- `public/index.php` → `index.php`
- `public/uploads/` → `uploads/`
- `public/install.php` → `install.php`
- `public/qr.php` → `qr.php`
- `public/changelog.html` → `changelog.html`

### 2. **Path Updates**
- Updated all `/public/` references to `/` in:
  - Controllers (TicketsController, EventController, OrganizerController, etc.)
  - Views (main.php, travel_booking_show.php)
  - Autoloader paths in `index.php` and `config/config.php`

### 3. **Configuration Updates**
- Updated `.htaccess` for clean URL routing
- `base_url()` function already configured for clean URLs
- Added security rules to block access to sensitive directories

## 🌐 **URL Structure**

### Before (Old URLs)
```
http://localhost/ticko/public/
https://shikaticket.com/public/
```

### After (Clean URLs) ✅
```
http://localhost/ticko/
https://shikaticket.com/
```

## 🔒 **Security Features**

- Blocked access to sensitive files (`.sql`, `.log`, `.md`, `.txt`)
- Protected directories: `config/`, `app/`, `database/`, `storage/`, `vendor/`
- Clean URL routing through `.htaccess`

## ✅ **Testing**

The application should now work with clean URLs:
- **Local:** `http://localhost/ticko/`
- **Production:** `https://shikaticket.com/`

## 🚀 **Benefits**

1. **Clean URLs:** No more `/public/` in URLs
2. **Better SEO:** Cleaner URL structure
3. **Professional appearance:** URLs look more professional
4. **Easier deployment:** Simpler file structure
5. **Better security:** Protected sensitive directories

## 📝 **Notes**

- All file uploads now go to `uploads/` instead of `public/uploads/`
- All image references updated automatically
- PDF generation paths updated
- QR code generation paths updated
- Email template paths updated
