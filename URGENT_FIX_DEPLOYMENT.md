# üö® URGENT: Registration White Screen Fix Deployment

## Critical Issue Discovered

The debug test at https://shikaticket.com/test_registration_debug.php revealed the root cause:

### **Base URL is generating WRONG paths!**

- **Generated:** `https://shikaticket.com/user/dashboard` ‚ùå
- **Expected:** `https://shikaticket.com/public/user/dashboard` ‚úÖ
- **Missing:** `/public/` in the URL path

This is why users see a white screen - they're being redirected to URLs that don't exist!

---

## Additional Issues Found

1. **SMS Service Output Issue**: `Sms.php` had a closing PHP tag `?>` with trailing newlines causing "headers already sent" errors
2. **Base URL Detection**: Function wasn't detecting the production server environment correctly

---

## Files That Need to be Uploaded to Live Server

Upload these **3 files** to https://shikaticket.com/:

### 1. ‚úÖ `config/config.php` (CRITICAL - UPDATED)
**Changes made:**
- Added explicit detection for `shikaticket.com` domain ‚Üí always uses `/public/` base path
- Enhanced redirect() function with fallback for "headers already sent" errors
- Forces HTTPS for production domain

**Key fix (lines 169-171):**
```php
// Production server: shikaticket.com (always use /public)
if (strpos($host, 'shikaticket.com') !== false) {
    $base = '/public';
}
```

### 2. ‚úÖ `app/Controllers/AuthController.php` (CRITICAL - UPDATED)
**Changes made:**
- Uses proper `SessionSecurityService::setUserSession()` for session initialization
- All email/SMS wrapped in try-catch blocks (non-blocking)
- Proper error handling with flash messages and redirects
- Fetches user data before session setup

### 3. ‚úÖ `app/Services/Sms.php` (IMPORTANT - UPDATED)
**Changes made:**
- Removed closing PHP tag `?>` that was causing output
- Removed trailing blank lines
- Prevents "headers already sent" errors

### 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è `test_registration_fix.php` (TEMPORARY - FOR TESTING)
**Purpose:**
- Comprehensive test to verify all fixes work correctly
- **MUST DELETE AFTER TESTING** (security risk!)

---

## Deployment Steps (FOLLOW EXACTLY)

### Step 1: Backup Current Files (IMPORTANT!)
Before uploading, backup these files from your live server:
- `config/config.php`
- `app/Controllers/AuthController.php`
- `app/Services/Sms.php`

### Step 2: Upload Updated Files
Via FTP/cPanel File Manager:
1. Upload `config/config.php` ‚Üí Replace existing file
2. Upload `app/Controllers/AuthController.php` ‚Üí Replace existing file
3. Upload `app/Services/Sms.php` ‚Üí Replace existing file
4. Upload `test_registration_fix.php` ‚Üí Root directory

### Step 3: Run Verification Test
1. Open browser and go to: **https://shikaticket.com/test_registration_fix.php**
2. Check all tests show **‚úÖ PASSED**
3. Look for: "All URLs are correct!" message
4. Verify Base URL shows: `https://shikaticket.com/public/user/dashboard`

### Step 4: Delete Test Files (CRITICAL!)
**For security, DELETE these files from your server:**
- `/test_registration_debug.php`
- `/test_registration_fix.php`

### Step 5: Test Real Registration
1. Open **incognito/private browser window**
2. Go to: https://shikaticket.com/public/register
3. Register with NEW phone number and email:
   - Phone: Use a real Kenyan number (e.g., 0792xxxxxx)
   - Email: Use a real email you can check
   - Password: At least 8 characters
4. Click "Register"
5. **Expected result:** You should be redirected to the dashboard page ‚úÖ
6. **Old behavior:** White screen ‚ùå

### Step 6: Verify Dashboard Works
After registration:
- Dashboard should load with your user info
- You should see: "Registration successful! Welcome to ShikaTicket" message
- Menu navigation should work
- You should be able to log out and log back in

## What Was Fixed - Technical Details

### Before (Broken):
```php
// OLD base_url() - didn't detect shikaticket.com correctly
} else {
    // For local development
    $base = rtrim(dirname($scriptName), '/');
    // On live server, this returned empty string!
}
```

**Result:** URLs generated as `https://shikaticket.com/user/dashboard` (404 error ‚Üí white screen)

### After (Fixed):
```php
// NEW base_url() - explicit shikaticket.com detection
if (strpos($host, 'shikaticket.com') !== false) {
    $base = '/public';  // Always use /public for production
}
```

**Result:** URLs generate as `https://shikaticket.com/public/user/dashboard` (correct! ‚úÖ)

---

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### User Registration Flow:
1. User fills registration form
2. Account created in database ‚úÖ
3. Session properly initialized with `SessionSecurityService` ‚úÖ
4. Welcome SMS sent (non-blocking, logs error if fails) ‚úÖ
5. Welcome email sent (non-blocking, logs error if fails) ‚úÖ
6. User redirected to: `https://shikaticket.com/public/user/dashboard` ‚úÖ
7. Dashboard loads showing success message ‚úÖ

### What Happens if Email/SMS Fails:
- **Old behavior:** Registration would fail with white screen ‚ùå
- **New behavior:** Registration succeeds, error logged, user redirected successfully ‚úÖ

---

## Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify all these work:

- [ ] Test script shows all URLs correct (with `/public/`)
- [ ] New user registration completes successfully
- [ ] User redirected to dashboard (not white screen)
- [ ] Dashboard page loads correctly
- [ ] Success message shows: "Registration successful!"
- [ ] User can navigate menu
- [ ] User can log out
- [ ] User can log back in
- [ ] Test files deleted from server
- [ ] No "headers already sent" errors in error log

---

## Monitoring

### After Deployment - Check Error Logs

Check `public/error_log` for these messages:

#### ‚úÖ Good (Non-blocking):
```
Welcome email failed: [error message]  ‚Üê OK, user registration still works
Welcome SMS failed: [error message]    ‚Üê OK, user registration still works
```

#### ‚ùå Bad (Needs attention):
```
Cannot redirect to https://... - headers already sent  ‚Üê Should be fixed now
Registration error: [error message]                     ‚Üê Indicates new issue
```

### View Error Logs:
```bash
# Via SSH
tail -f ~/shikaticket.com/public/error_log

# Or download via FTP and open in text editor
```

---

## Rollback Plan (If Issues Occur)

If something goes wrong:

1. **Restore backed up files** from Step 1
2. **Clear browser cache and cookies**
3. **Check error_log for specific errors**
4. **Contact developer with error log content**

### Quick Rollback via cPanel:
1. Go to File Manager
2. Navigate to backup folder
3. Restore the 3 backed up files
4. Test again

## Additional Notes

### Why This Happened:
The `base_url()` function was designed for local development with path `/ticko/public/` but didn't have explicit handling for the production server at `shikaticket.com`. On the live server, the auto-detection logic failed and returned an empty base path.

### Why It Worked Locally:
Local development uses `http://localhost/ticko/public/` which was detected correctly by the `elseif` conditions in the old code.

### Why Test Script Showed Wrong URL:
Because test script was in root (`/test_registration_debug.php`), not in `/public/`, so `$_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME']` didn't contain `/public/`, causing detection to fail.

### The Fix:
Added explicit check: "If domain is `shikaticket.com`, always use `/public/`" - simple and bulletproof!
